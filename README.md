# Petrol Price Analysis & Forecast using Prophet

This project analyzes and predicts oil prices using Facebook Prophet. 
It involves time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals) and forecasting future prices based on historical data. 
The process includes data collection, cleaning, decomposition, and prediction. 
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies (pandas, matplotlib, prophet), users can run the analysis on their own datasets. 
Results include visualized components of the time series and future predictions. 
Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
